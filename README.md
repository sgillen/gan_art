# GAN Art

**What is this?**  
I trained a generative adversarial network to make art. This isn't a new idea, I used the network architecture and training tricks from [this  paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03410) and stole a lot of code from [this blog post](https://blog.jovian.ai/generating-art-with-gans-352ceef3d51f). 

Anyway, check out [this colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18IZDjAczvMmA3uPRN3P_8Q4IJxJ9ePwj?usp=sharing) where you can interactively explore the art generated by the trained model!
