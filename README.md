# Exploring Art GANs

This paper inspired by [this](https://blog.jovian.ai/generating-art-with-gans-352ceef3d51f) blog post and [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03410)

I trained a Generative Adversarial Network to generate novel art images.

TODO elaborate on that.

I use the wiki art data set hosted here: http://web.fsktm.um.edu.my/~cschan/source/ICIP2017/wikiart.zip
You will need to run preprocess.py and then train.py. I switched the learning rate from .0002 to 0.00005 after 100 epochs.

Anyway, you should really just take a look at the google collab, where you can play with the trained thing.
